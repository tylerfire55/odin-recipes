    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>The Ham and Cheese sandwich is a lovely, divine treat that will surely raise the spirits of any that dare to attempt a construction <br>
    of this simply ambrosic meal. Despite being divine in taste, the process is more demonic than anything else you know, so be prepared.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Ham or honey Ham</li>
        <li>Cheese, preferably swiss, provolone, or meunster.</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li><b>OPTIONAL:</b> Mayonaisse</li>
        <li><b>OPTIONAL:</b> Mustard, spicy brown or yellow</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><i>If these ingredients are hard to find, call your priest for help!</i></h5>

    <h3>How to Make!</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>First, get 2 (two) slices of bread, separate them from inbetween each other, and set them out in front of you.</li>
        <li>Next, if you have mayo and mustard, please apply a thin and even layer of each to both pieces of bread. Keep i mind <br>
        that if you do not apply even amounts of the ingredients, you will have to perform an exorcism.</li>
        <li>Continuing on, start to place your slices of ham ontop of your mayo or mustard. It does not matter which slice <br>
        you choose for this step, as God will make sure your performance is of His ultimate plan.</li>
        <li>Next, please mirror what you did in the previous step on the other slice of bread with the cheese. Make sure <br>
        to put a 1:1 ratio of cheese to ham for an even eating experience. Taste is king!</li>
        <li>Finally, reassemble the pieces of bread in the exact same orientation you found them in originally, making sure to touch the <br>
        sides that have the ingredents on them, and then take a bite! If you don't take a bite within 30 seconds, you will have to fight <br>
        a demon, and even if you will, the demon will have eaten your sandwich, meaning you must start over.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>That's it!</h3>
    <p>Now that you've made your sandwich and taken a bite, you can continue to take more bites! Doing so will slowly fuel your body and turn you <br>
    into the ultimate organic machine. If your body needs more, simply repeat the process above.</p>
