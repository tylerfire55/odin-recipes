    <h3>How to Make!</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>First, get 2 (two) slices of bread, separate them from inbetween each other, and set them out in front of you.</li>
        <li>Next, using a butter knife or spoon, grab any amount of peanut butter you'd like, and carefully spread it evenly over the <br>
        entire piece of bread, not leaving any spot unmarked with your extraordinary ingredient. Make sure to remember that the amount of <br>
        peanut butter you add needs to be a 1:1 ratio with the jelly you add in the next step. If you end up adding too much peanut <br>
        butter, and not enough jelly, you can always try to save your mouth with some milk!</li>
        <li>Continuing, using a cleaned butter knife or spoon (to not cross contaminate your ingredients) proceed to grab the exact <br>
        same amount of jelly as you did peanut butter, and spread it evenly across every corner of the bread.</li>
        <li>Finally, reassemble the pieces of bread in the exact same orientation you found them in originally, making sure to touch the <br>
        sides that have the ingredents on them, and then take a bite! If you don't take a bite within 30 seconds, the sandwich will explode.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>That's it!</h3>
    <p>Now that you've made your sandwich and taken a bite, you can continue to take more bites! Doing so will slowly fuel your body and turn you <br>
    into the ultimate organic machine. If your body needs more, simply repeat the process above.</p>
